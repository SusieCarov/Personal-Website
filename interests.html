					One of my newest interests is Broadway. The artistry of it all amazes me. There are all of these people and skills, from the set design, to the sound and lights, the scripts and music to the logistics of getting everyone and everything to the right spot at the right time, and of course the stunning talent of the performers. All of these things come together seamlessly to create an unforgettable experience and it’s amazing!

					I really love traveling! I’ve traveled to all 50 states, and to make it even crazier it was all in one year. It was my mom’s 50th birthday and my family decided that to celebrate by visiting all 50 states. It took a lot of planning and coordination, but over long weekends and holidays (including 14 states over Thanksgiving break) we rode planes, trains, and automobiles all over the US. I learned heaps of history, saw amazing art, ate fabulous food, and loved every minute of it!

				<p class="interests-text" id="disney-text">
					You may not know it, but Disney World is "The Happiest Place on Earth!" From the rides, parades, and shows, to the shopping, food, and people watching, there is so much to do! And it all has that magical Disney attention to detail. <br><br>
					Of course the Disney movies and songs are fabulous too!
				</p>
				<p class="interests-text" id="games-text">
					I enjoy puzzles and riddles because I love exploring the options to find the one piece, whether it’s a jigsaw puzzle piece or a piece of information, that fits just right. And games are basically just puzzles with friends! You just need to find the strategy that best suits this game at this moment, and I love coming up with new strategies or tweaking old standbys as my opponents and their strategies change.
